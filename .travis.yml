 # An attempt to explain my understanding of the rather odd convergence of Travis CI and tox with tox-travis
# The TEST envvironment variables are way to get Travis CI to run the four tox builds in parallel
# Then in tox.ini one has to
# * list the 4 envs so tox knows what it is [envlist]
# * list them again for building with python 3.6 [travis
# * list them again against the evnironment variables to trick the matrix into existance [travis:env]
# Finally, define each env as [envlist]
# There is probably a simpler way. I hope.
